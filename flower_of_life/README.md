This folder contains code for the 55-LED 'flower of life' I made in
Nov 2012.

Super simple hardware this time: prototyping with a spare
atmega328_radio_slave board at 3v3, but the final version will just be
a bit of stripboard with a 2.1mm power socket, an ATMEGA328P-PU
running at 5V in internal oscillator mode (with pullup res and
decouping cap), and a connector for the LEDs.
